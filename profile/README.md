## 🧠 Overview

**Dolby Atmos** is an advanced audio processing environment designed to create immersive, three-dimensional sound experiences. It enables sound elements to be positioned and moved within a virtual space, delivering depth and realism beyond traditional channel-based audio systems.

The platform is widely used across music production, film post-production, and interactive media workflows. By focusing on object-based audio placement, it allows creators to build dynamic soundscapes that adapt naturally to different playback systems.
